# Dylan Campbell — Data Science Portfolio

Hello world — this repository contains two curated projects demonstrating my data-driven approach to real-world problems, clean Python code, reproducible analysis, and clear communication of results. I recently completed a Bachelor’s degree in Data Science and am seeking entry-level roles in Data Analytics, Data Science, or Information Systems-focused data roles.

## What you'll find here
Each project is self-contained in `projects/<project-name>/` and includes:
- A project-specific README
- Code (`.ipynb` and/or `.py`)
- Instructions to reproduce key results
- A short write-up of insights and next steps

## Featured Projects
1. **NFL Playoff Berth KPIs** (`projects/playoff-berth-analysis/`) — analysis identifying key performance indicators associated with achieving an NFL playoff berth, with emphasis on offensive vs. defensive metrics.
2. **Crime Resolution Time & Crime Hotspots in Travis County** (`projects/socioeconomic-factors-crime/`) — capstone-style analysis examining the relationship between socioeconomic factors, crime patterns, and resolution timelines.

## How I work
I focus on clear, reproducible analysis that communicates outcomes to non-technical stakeholders:
- Clean, well-documented Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Emphasis on EDA, feature engineering, and interpretable metrics
- Notebook + script pattern: exploratory analysis in notebooks, with reusable logic refactored into .py files.
- Incremental commits and light testing to demonstrate iterative development

## AI Assistance
I use AI tools to improve clarity and efficiency (for example: project structure, documentation drafts, and code refactors). All analysis decisions, data cleaning, and model selections are reviewed and performed by me.

## Reproduce results
Each project contains a `README` that explains:
1. Data sources (links or instructions)
2. Dependency setup (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. How to run the notebook or script to reproduce figures/tables
4. Notes on runtime and data access

Thanks for looking — I’m happy to discuss any projects or share a curated subset for specific roles.
