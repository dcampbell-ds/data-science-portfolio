# Socioeconomic Factors in Crime & Resolution

## Overview
Capstone project examining relationships between socioeconomic indicators,
crime patterns, and resolution timelines in Travis County, Texas.

## Project Context
This analysis was completed as a group capstone project as part of a university
data science program. The final notebook and datasets were submitted as a single
group deliverable, and I no longer have access to the full project artifacts.

## My Contributions
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of multi-source datasets
- Exploratory data analysis to identify crime hotspots
- Feature engineering and statistical analysis
- Development of visualizations to communicate findings to non-technical stakeholders

## Methods & Tools
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Statistical modeling and exploratory analysis
- Data visualization (Python / Tableau)

## Key Takeaways
This project emphasized collaborative data analysis, integrating heterogeneous
data sources, and translating complex findings into actionable insights in a
public-sector analytics context.

## Notes
I am able to discuss this project in detail, including methodology, challenges,
and analytical decisions, despite not having access to the final submitted files.
