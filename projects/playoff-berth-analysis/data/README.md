## Data

This project uses publicly available NFL team-level statistics aggregated by season.

Raw datasets are not included in this repository due to licensing considerations
and file size constraints.

The data includes:
- Offensive metrics (e.g., points scored, yards gained, turnovers)
- Defensive metrics (e.g., points allowed, yards allowed)
- Team outcomes (playoff berth indicator)

Equivalent datasets can be obtained from public sports statistics sources
such as Pro-Football-Reference or similar aggregators.
